## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

1. **Understand core programming concepts:**
   - Variables (storing information)
   - Functions (reusable code blocks)
   - Conditionals (decision-making with if/else)
   - Events (responding to user actions)
   - APIs (using browser features)

2. **Build a complete working game** that demonstrates these concepts

3. **Experience accessible web development** with high contrast, audio feedback, and screen reader compatibility

4. **Gain confidence** in their ability to create technology solutions

## ♿ Accessibility Teaching Approach

### For Screen Reader Users:
- Describe everything you type character by character
- Read all code aloud before and after typing
- Use semantic HTML landmarks for navigation
- Test with actual screen reader if available

### For Low Vision Students:
- Use high contrast color schemes throughout
- Large, clear fonts and buttons
- Zoom browser text as needed
- Describe visual layout and changes

### For Motor Impairments:
- Emphasize keyboard navigation
- Large click targets
- No time pressure - work at student's pace
- Alternative input methods if needed

### Universal Design Principles:
- Multiple ways to receive information (visual, audio, tactile)
- Clear, simple language in all instructions
- Consistent navigation and interaction patterns
- Forgiving interface that handles mistakes gracefully

---

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Minimum Requirements:
- **Computer:** Any laptop/desktop with web browser
- **Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge (current versions)
- **Audio:** Speakers or headphones for speech synthesis
- **Text Editor:** VS Code recommended, any plain text editor works
- **Files:** All session files copied to desktop

### Recommended Setup:
- **Display:** Large monitor or high zoom settings
- **Audio:** Good quality speakers for clear speech
- **Assistive Technology:** Screen reader if student uses one
- **Backup:** Secondary computer/browser in case of issues
- **Internet:** Optional - all materials work offline

## 👩‍🏫 Instructor Preparation

### Before the Session:
1. **Test all files** in the browser you'll be using
2. **Check audio works** - test speech synthesis and sound effects
3. **Review accessibility features** of student's preferred tools
4. **Practice narrating code** - describe every character you type
5. **Prepare backup plans** for common technical issues

### Key Teaching Skills:
- **Patience** - Programming has a learning curve
- **Clear narration** - Verbalize everything you do
- **Encouraging tone** - Celebrate small victories
- **Problem-solving mindset** - Mistakes are learning opportunities
- **Flexibility** - Adjust pace to student needs

## 🎉 Final Notes

**Remember:** The goal isn't to create perfect programmers in one hour. The goal is to spark curiosity, build confidence, and show that programming is accessible to everyone.

**Every programmer started exactly where these students are today.** By making their first program accessible and engaging, we're opening doors to a lifetime of creative problem-solving and technological empowerment.

**Success is measured in smiles, "aha!" moments, and excited questions about what else they can build.**

*Happy teaching! May your students discover the joy of making computers do amazing things! 🚀*
