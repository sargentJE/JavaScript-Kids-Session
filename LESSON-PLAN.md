# JavaScript for Kids: Building the "Number Detective" Game
## 1-Hour Accessible Programming Session

**Instructor:** Jamie Sargent, MyVision Oxfordshire  
**Duration:** 60 minutes  
**Audience:** 2 visually impaired children (no JavaScript experience)  
**Goal:** Learn basic JavaScript by building an accessible audio-based guessing game

---

## Session Overview

The children will build "Number Detective" - an accessible number guessing game where players try to guess a secret number between 1-10. The game provides audio feedback, works with screen readers, and teaches fundamental programming concepts.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will understand:
- What variables are and how to use them
- How functions work and why they're useful
- Basic if/else decision making
- How to get user input
- How websites can talk to users with audio
- The satisfaction of building something that works!

---

## Materials Needed

- 2 computers with web browsers
- Text editors (VS Code recommended)
- Screen readers if preferred
- This lesson folder with all files
- Enthusiasm and patience!

## Session Timeline (60 minutes)

### Opening (5 minutes) - Welcome & Demo
- Welcome and introductions
- Demo the finished Number Detective game
- Explain what we'll build together
- Check everyone can access their computer and browser

### Part 1 (15 minutes) - Building the Foundation
**File: `step1-foundation.html`**
- Create basic HTML structure
- Add our game title and instructions
- Learn about HTML elements that screen readers love
- Test in browser - see our foundation!

**Key Concepts:**
- HTML gives structure to websites
- Headings help screen readers navigate
- IDs help us find elements later

### Part 2 (15 minutes) - Adding Interactivity
**File: `step2-basic-javascript.html`**
- Add input field and button
- Write our first JavaScript function
- Learn about variables (storing the secret number)
- Make the button actually do something

**Key Concepts:**
- Variables store information
- Functions are reusable blocks of code
- addEventListener connects buttons to actions

### Part 3 (15 minutes) - Game Logic & Decisions
**File: `step3-game-logic.html`**
- Add if/else statements for game logic
- Compare player guess to secret number
- Display different messages for different outcomes
- Test our working game logic!

**Key Concepts:**
- if/else helps programs make decisions
- Comparison operators (===, <, >) 
- Programs can respond differently to different situations

### Part 4 (8 minutes) - Audio Feedback
**File: `step4-audio-feedback.html`**
- Add speech synthesis for audio feedback
- Make the game announce results out loud
- Add sound effects using Web Audio
- Test full accessible experience

**Key Concepts:**
- Websites can speak to users
- Audio makes games more engaging
- Accessibility benefits everyone

### Wrap-up (2 minutes)
- Celebrate what we built!
- Talk about next steps and other programming possibilities
- Share the complete game file to take home

## Teaching Notes

### For Visual Impairments:
- Describe everything you're typing as you type it
- Read aloud all code and explain what each part does
- Use high contrast in text editor if helpful
- Encourage screen reader use if students prefer
- Make liberal use of audio feedback to verify things work

### Common Challenges:
- **Typos**: Very common! Build in time for debugging
- **Syntax errors**: Use this as teaching moment about precision
- **Overwhelm**: Keep explanations simple, focus on what not why
- **Different paces**: Have extension activities ready

### Extension Activities (if time):
- Add more number ranges (1-100)
- Add a "play again" button
- Count number of guesses
- Add difficulty levels

### Accessibility Features Built In:
- High contrast colors
- Large, clear buttons
- Screen reader compatible structure
- Keyboard navigation
- Audio feedback
- Clear focus indicators

## Key Programming Concepts Covered

1. **Variables** - Storing information the computer remembers
2. **Functions** - Reusable blocks of code that do specific tasks
3. **Conditionals** - How programs make decisions (if/else)
4. **DOM Manipulation** - How JavaScript changes what appears on screen
5. **Event Handling** - How programs respond to user actions
6. **APIs** - Using built-in browser features (speech synthesis)

---

## Assessment / Success Indicators

Students successfully understand the concepts if they can:
- Explain what a variable does in their own words
- Identify where we use if/else in our game
- Suggest how to modify the game (different number range, etc.)
- Successfully run their completed game
- Show excitement about what they've built!

---

## Take-Home Materials

- Complete game files
- Simplified explanation sheet for parents/guardians
- Ideas for next programming steps
- Contact information for follow-up questions

---

## Instructor Preparation Notes

### Before Session:
- Test all code files work on intended browsers
- Prepare backup copies in case of technical issues
- Have screen reader available if students use them
- Test audio feedback on all devices

### During Session:
- Type slowly and describe each character
- Ask "what do you think this will do?" before running code
- Celebrate every small success
- If someone gets stuck, help their partner help them
- Use correct terminology but explain it simply

### After Session:
- Follow up with any debugging help needed
- Share additional resources for continued learning
- Document what worked well for future sessions
