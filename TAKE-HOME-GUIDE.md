## What We Built Today 🎮

Your child built their very first computer program - a fun, accessible guessing game called "Number Detective"! Using JavaScript (a real programming language used by professional developers), they created a game that:

- Picks a random secret number
- Takes guesses from players
- Gives helpful hints ("too high" or "too low")
- Celebrates when you win
- Speaks out loud using the computer's voice
- Keeps track of your score

## Programming Concepts Learned 🧠

### 1. **Variables** - Storing Information
Think of variables like labeled boxes that hold information:
```javascript
let secretNumber = 7;  // A box labeled "secretNumber" containing 7
let guessCount = 0;    // A box labeled "guessCount" containing 0
```

### 2. **Functions** - Reusable Instructions
Functions are like recipes - step-by-step instructions the computer can follow:
```javascript
function checkGuess() {
    // Steps for checking if the guess is correct
}
```

### 3. **Conditionals** - Making Decisions
The computer uses if/else to make different choices:
```javascript
if (playerGuess === secretNumber) {
    // You won!
} else if (playerGuess < secretNumber) {
    // Too low!
} else {
    // Too high!
}
```

### 4. **Events** - Responding to Actions
The computer listens for button clicks and keyboard presses:
```javascript
button.addEventListener('click', checkGuess);
```

### 5. **APIs** - Using Built-in Features
We used the computer's speech abilities:
```javascript
speech.speak("Hello! You got it right!");
```

## Files on Your Computer 💾

Your child has these files from today's session:

1. **`step1-foundation.html`** - Basic structure
2. **`step2-basic-javascript.html`** - First JavaScript
3. **`step3-game-logic.html`** - Game logic with if/else
4. **`step4-audio-feedback.html`** - Audio features
5. **`final-complete-game.html`** - Enhanced version with difficulty levels

### How to Open and Play:
1. Find the HTML files on your computer
2. Double-click any file to open in web browser
3. Play the game by entering numbers and clicking buttons
4. Use keyboard shortcuts: Enter (guess), Ctrl+N (new game), Ctrl+M (mute)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues 🔧

**Game won't load:**
- Make sure you're opening the .html file in a web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Check that all files are in the same folder

**No sound:**
- Check computer volume is on
- Try clicking "Test Audio" button
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio

**Code doesn't work after changes:**
- Right-click in browser → "Inspect" → "Console" to see error messages
- Make sure you saved the file after making changes
- Check for typos in any code you modified
